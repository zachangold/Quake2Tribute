Notes:
	- The materials (e.g., maps and textures) from Quake II need to be unpacked and placed in a Q2/ subdirectory before this application can be run.
	- The program can get slow when you move outside of the map (because it disables BSP culling).
	  For best results, try staying within the map.

The controls:
	- W : move forward
	- S : move backward
	- A : move left
	- D : move right
	- Space : move up
	- C : move down
	- Shift : move faster
	- L : enable lightmapping
	- K : disable lightmapping
	- O : enable monsters (in beta)
	- P : disable monsters
	- Escape : quit the program
	- M : change the map. To scroll through the menu, use the up and down arrow keys. To load the selected map, press Enter

To change screen resolution:
	- Open config.txt
	- replace the first line with your screen's width in pixels
	- replace the second line with your screen's height in pixels
	- save and close, then run
